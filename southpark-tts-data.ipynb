    "# South Park TTS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this [SoS notebook](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/) is to prepare a dataset for learning a text to speech (TTS) system from South Park video data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general pipeline is applicable to creating TTS data when subtitles are available, *except* for the speaker identification component used here, which requires South Park transcripts with speaker annotations.\n",
    "It's possible that the method of speaker identification used here would translate to other datasets that had some type of speaker annotation, but this would likely require some nontrivial modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the South Park TTS dataset involved the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert DVDs\n",
    "2. Extract subtitles\n",
    "3. Align subtitles with audio sufficiently for labeled data needs\n",
    "4. Do speaker identification\n",
    "5. Create WAV/transcript data in suitable format (e.g. [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/))"

    "\n",
    "Originally the goal was to just get the ISOs for the DVDs to allow batch processing.\n",
    "However, strange obfuscation was used on the DVDs, presumably to prevent copyright infringement.\n",
    "As a result, each DVD had to be transcoded to MP4 using Handbrake. \n",
    "This was the only option of those tried that preserved the subtitle information.\n",
    "The following manual steps were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discs up to season 13 where converted to ISO using various programs (NOTE: Handbrake could probably have been used instead and would have resulted in more homogenous outputs; some idiosyncratic processing below could possibly have been avoided by using Handbrake everywhere)\n",
    "- Handbrake was run over these and then each succeeding disc\n",
    "    - Seasons 1-12: detelecine + decombe (4:3 format)\n",
    "    - Season 13-17: no detelecine or decombe\n",
    "    - Season 18-20: detelecine + decombe\n",
    "    - Season 15-20: closed captions replaced with image subtitles\n",
